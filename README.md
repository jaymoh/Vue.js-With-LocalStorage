# Vue.js-With-LocalStorage
A complete Vue.js CRUD app with LocalStorage. 

Apparently there are not enough Todo apps, here is another one -- running completely inside your browser. 

#installation
<b>'git clone https://github.com/jaymoh/Vue.js-With-LocalStorage.git' </b> into your development directory, cd into the folder and run the commands below in your terminal to run the app: <br>
<b>npm install</b> <br>
<b>npm run serve</b>

You must have Node.js installed. 

This repo was created for <a href="https://howtocreateapps.com/localstorage-vue-js-tutorial/" target="_blank">this Vue.js with LocalStorage Tutorial</a>. If you landed here from this link, check out the first commit - it's the commit that follows that tutorial (up to saving and retrieving data from LocalStorage). I added the rest of the CRUD functions (Update, Delete), and a markComplete todo item method.
